# This file contains commands to generate a shared object or DLL
# for a natively compiled PL/SQL unit. 
# This file can have multiple commands. 
# Each command should be specified in a single line by itself terminated by
# a newline.
# Lines starting with a # character are comments which are ignored.
# Each command is executed by creating (forking) a process and
# giving the command to the process to be executed directly.
# That means no other program (such as a shell or make) is used
# to interpret these commands.
# The command(s) use the following symbolic names as placeholders
# which will be replaced by actual names before executing the command(s).
#
# 	%(src) -  refers to the name of the generated C source file.
# 	%(obj) -  refers to the name of the generated object file.
# 	%(exp) -  refers to the name of the generated export file.
# 	%(imp) -  refers to the name of the generated import file.
# 	%(so)  -  refers to the name of the generated shared object file.
#
# The variable $(ORACLE_HOME) will be replaced by its actual value
# before executing the command(s).
#
# NOTE:  The recommended optimization level for the C compiler is
#        -O1. The generated C code is such that any optimization level
#        above -O1 results in significantly longer C compilation times
#        without any tangible incremental benefit in runtime performance.
#        However, on AIX even O1 will result in out-of-memory problem
#        in the compiler for a few cases. So not using any optimization.
