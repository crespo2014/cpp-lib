SuperPro 6.0 Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0/6.0 Sample Program
==========================================================

This program shows you how to find and query your SuperPro key based on the
steps provided in the SuperPro Developers Toolkit.  It is a working example of
how to verify a valid licensed SuperPro is attached to the computer. 

Some changes to the source code will be necessary to use this program with the
keys supplied to you.  The sample was written using our demo hardware key so
you will have to update the developer ID, cell number, and the Query Table to
match the values given by the SuperPro Developers Toolkit.

Any code used in this sample program may be used in your own application to
simplify adding the protection of the SuperPro to your product.

This represents a basic example of how to protect your application.  There are
many other advanced techniques that can be incorporated into your product to
further enhance the security of your application.  See the included manuals or
contact Rainbow Technologies Technical Support for further explanation of
these advanced techniques.
